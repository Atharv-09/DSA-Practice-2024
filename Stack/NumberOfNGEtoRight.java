/*Given an array of N integers and Q queries of indices. Return a list NGEs[] where NGEs[i] stores the count of elements strictly greater than the current element (arr[indices[i]]) to the right of indices[i].
Input:  arr[]     = [3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 10, 6]
        queries = 2
        indices[] = [0, 5]
Output:  6, 1
Explanation: The next greater elements to the right of 3(index 0) are 4,7,5,8,10,6. The next greater elements to the right of 8(index 5) is only 10.

*/

//PROBLEM : 
// we will have the arr and indices such that
// for that index we have to check how many next greater element are thier to its right
